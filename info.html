            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The CoC System is a lightweight digital Chain of Custody tool designed to securely store and manage evidence during digital forensic investigations.
                Supervisors can create cases and assign investigators to collaborate within a controlled and secure environment.
                Every action taken in the system is automatically logged to ensure transparency, accountability, and the integrity of the investigation process.

                <li>Creating new cases.</li>
                <li>Assigning investigators to cases.</li>
                <li>Monitoring the progress of ongoing investigations.</li>
                <li>Assigning existing evidence to different cases.</li>
                <li>Reviewing case reports.</li>
                <li>Closing cases when investigations are complete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Supervisors act as coordinators and overseers, with full permissions to manage cases and maintain security, transparency, and credibility throughout the investigation process.
